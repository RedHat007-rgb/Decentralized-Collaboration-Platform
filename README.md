# Decentralized Collaboration Platform

## Overview
This is a futuristic platform that combines real-time collaboration, AI-powered analytics, and Web-3 technologies (using Solana) to enable secure, decentralized teamwork. Built with React (frontend) and Node.js (backend), it aims to showcase skills in modern web development, AI, and blockchain, targeting top startups in Web-3, AI, and DevOps.

## Features
- Real-time collaboration for documents and tasks.
- User authentication and secure data storage.
- Integration with Solana for decentralized features.
- AI-driven analytics (planned for future expansion).
- Scalable backend with MongoDB.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed (LTS version recommended).
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB) for data storage.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) and terminal.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or create a new folder named "DecentralizedCollaborationPlatform."
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. In the `backend` folder, run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
4. Set up a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string`).
5. Start the backend by navigating to `backend` and running `node server.js`.
6. Start the frontend by navigating to `frontend` and running `npm run dev`.

## Usage
- Open your browser to the URL provided by `npm run dev` (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
- Log in or register to access the collaboration dashboard.
- Use the real-time editor to collaborate with others (simulated for now).

## Future Plans
- Integrate Solana smart contracts for decentralized data storage.
- Add AI agents for task automation and analytics using Java microservices.
- Implement DevOps practices (Docker, Kubernetes) for deployment.
- Expand with cross-chain interoperability (e.g., Ethereum).
